# 🔐 StegoPDF | Stealth Protocol

**Military-grade steganography. Hide data within PDF binary structures invisible to forensic scanners.**

StegoPDF is an advanced steganographic editor designed to embed secret data—including text, high-resolution images, and audio—directly into the metadata layers of a PDF document. Unlike standard annotation tools, StegoPDF uses binary layer injection and deep stealth compression to ensure hidden artifacts are completely undetectable to standard viewers and forensic tools.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🕵️‍♂️ Invisible Data Concealment

Advanced techniques embed data within internal Keywords streams. Standard PDF viewers detect zero changes to the document while your data remains securely hidden in the binary layer.

### 📦 Deep Stealth Compression

Integrated **GZIP Compression v2.0** ensures hidden artifacts look like natural digital entropy to forensic scanners. This protocol compresses data by up to 90% before embedding, allowing for large files to be hidden with a minimal footprint.

### 🎙️ Multimedia Embedding

Beyond text, StegoPDF supports live audio recordings and high-resolution imagery. Every hidden element is attached to specific document coordinates using geospatial data anchoring with sub-pixel accuracy.

### 🤖 Context-Aware AI Intelligence

Integrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model that "reads" your PDF structure at the binary level. Have natural language conversations with your encrypted documents in real-time without exposing the underlying steganography.
